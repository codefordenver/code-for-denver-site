### What kind of projects do we work on?
CfD provides technology, design, organizational, and coding expertise. Our primary goal is to support to those who do not have access to the kind of services we provide. This could be due to size or budget. Our ideal project involves:
- a small to medium-sized non-profit or public institution
- a product that is open-source, shareable, and reusable on other projects
- a need for at least one of our areas of expertise

- Watchdog groups
- Media organizations

### What is the project proposal process?
There are several steps to getting a project accepted for work with Code for Denver.
1. A potential partner completes an application.
2. A Code for Denver leader screens the application to make sure it fits the basic guidelines from above.
3. On the first Monday of each month the group considers each project according to two criteria:
    - Is the project appropriate for work by Code for Denver?
    - Is there a brigade member interested in following up/being the initial champion?
4. If the answer to both questions is yes, the project moves into the defined idea stage. If either answer is no a member follows up with the proposer to inform them we will not move forward with it.
The need for a champion is the most critical aspect of this process. Without a champion the project is leaderless within Code for Denver. Attending the meeting and connecting with members is key to us accepting your proposal.
Look at some of our *previously completed projects*(link this text) to get a sense of the work we do.

### What is the project development process?
Accepted projects have the following stages:
- Vague ideas
- Defined ideas
- Validation
- Active Development
- Support
