# Skills at Code for Denver

#### I'm not a programmer or I'm not interested in programming. Can I still get involved?

Yes! As long as you are willing to collaborate and engage there are numerous ways in which to be involved. As you can tell from our name, coding is a big part of what we do. But helping solve challenges in the community takes more than software expertise. Our brigade volunteers also have backgrounds in marketing, design, sales, facilitation, non-profits, project management, and more. Additional perspectives and experiences are always valued and welcome, so come on down!


#### I'm a beginner programmer. Can I still get involved?

Yes! Many of our members have been beginning programmers who have found the environment helpful to improve their abilities while providing something of value.


#### What languages / frameworks do you typically use?

We don't use one particular language or framework all of the time. While we have strong interests in ReactJS, Clojure, and Rails, what we use depends on the nature of the project and the groups that we serve.
