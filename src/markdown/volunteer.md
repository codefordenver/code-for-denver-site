## Background Information

**WE ARE SO EXCITED YOU ARE HERE!**

You are on your way to some serious civic hacking.

#### So how do I get involved?

Start by joining our Meetup.com group at [www.meetup.com/CodeForDenver](www.meetup.com/CodeForDenver). This is where we list all of our upcoming meetings and events. We meet weekly to work on projects. RSVP or just drop by and say hello.

#### How many people are working on a project at any given time?

This varies according the circumstances and there are no hard and fast rules that set a minimum or maximum number of volunteers per project. For the sake of efficiency, we aim to focus our efforts by limiting the number of projects in active development.

#### Is there any one person who is typically in charge of projects?

Each project has a scrum master, product owner, and tech lead. Organizers listed at our [Meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/CodeForDenver/) work to make sure that the roles are filled.

#### I'm not a programmer or I'm not interested in programming. Can I still get involved?

Yes! As long as you are willing to collaborate and engage there are numerous ways in which to be involved. As you can tell from our name, coding is a big part of what we do. But helping solve challenges in the community takes more than software expertise. Our brigade volunteers also have backgrounds in marketing, design, sales, facilitation, non-profits, project management, and more. Additional perspectives and experiences are always valued and welcome, so come on down!

#### I'm a beginner programmer. Can I still get involved?

Yes! Many of our members have been beginning programmers who have found the environment helpful to improve their abilities while providing something of value.

#### What languages / frameworks do you typically use?

We don't use one particular language or framework all of the time. While we have strong backgrounds in open source, what we use depends on the nature of the project and the groups that we serve.
