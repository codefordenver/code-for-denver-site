### Ugh! There are too many languages and resources to choose from! Where is the best place to start?

We suggest Codecademy or CodeSchool. Both start with the basics, have plenty of free courses, and can be completed entirely in your browser.

As far as languages are concerned, HTML/CSS, Ruby, JavaScript, and Python great languages to start with. All are in widespread use, cross-platform (used on/in multiple devices and environments), and are supported by plenty of documentation.
