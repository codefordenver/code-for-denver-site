# The Community

## How we use Agile

Code For Denver utilizes many Agile practices and tools in our distributed development environment to help us deliver the most value, at the earliest possible time to our partners.

## Roles

We sign up for the agile roles of Scrum Master and Product Owner for each project, and our Sprints last two weeks and end in demos.

## Meeting management

We complete a stand-up each week, and share what was done last week, what will be done in the coming week and surface any blockers. We also use the [Pomodoro time management technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) to focus our work during project nights.

## Tools

We utilize Github as our code repository with a kanban board inside the application “Waffle” that sits on top of the repo.  Within the waffleboard, we plan our project tasks using the familiar “backlog”, “ready”, “in progress” and “done” states for each task.

Our current workflow includes:

- General/team communication and chat: [Flowdock](http://www.flowdoc.com)
- Version Control: [Git](http://git-scm.com/), [Github](https://github.com/codefordenver)
- Story management: [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/)
- Documentation/Technical writing: [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B15HLk4_JV3nWjkyOGtFUmhKZDQ&amp;usp=sharing_eid)

Don’t worry if you’re unfamiliar with any of these tools. We'll help you get up and running.
