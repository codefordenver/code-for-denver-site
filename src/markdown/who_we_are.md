# Who We Are

Code for Denver is a cooperative and diverse group of volunteers, dedicated to solving the problems of our community with technology.

We are technologists, programmers, visual and graphic designers, product managers, community organizers, students, researchers, developers, UXâ€™ers and geeks. We are mothers and brothers and sisters and citizens. We are all working for a better Denver, a better America, and a better tomorrow.
