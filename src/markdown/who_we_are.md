# Who We Are

** Code For Denver is volunteer-driven, community outreach that improves peopleâ€™s lives through technology.

We are technologists, programmers, visual and graphic designers, product managers, community organizers, students, researchers, developers, UX'ers and geeks. We are mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, and citizens. We are all working for a better Denver, a better America, and a better tomorrow.
