# About

We believe technology and innovation are powerful tools we can all use to make our community an even more spectacular place to live.

We are a diverse group of volunteers who are passionate about leveraging the power of technology to benefit the people of our Denver community.

We tap into the potential of technology to tackle issues like food systems, food security, economic development, safety and justice.

We recognize that we are a part of a much larger movement to address some of the challenges that face our planet. In order to collectively have the biggest impact, we work in partnership and collaboration with both local government, and the international network of Code for America brigades of which we are a part.

We also team up with local non-profit organizations and other active community members to make sure we understand the issues, to brainstorm technology-based solutions, and to actualize our ideas in ways that aim for measurable community benefit.

### Background Information

#### What does Code for Denver typically do?

We work with nonprofits or local government to building apps or websites that serve their needs. Who we work with and what issues we address are determined during first Monday pitch nights.  To stay on top of the things throughout the year, we host weekly meetups to manage things and work on current projects.


#### To what degree is your work influenced by Code for America?
Code for America connects us to the wider civic technology movement. Through them, we are able to learn from other brigades,
We are a brigade of Code for America Brigade,
Our projects are member-driven. We seek inspiration from other brigades and adopt many of the working practices and values of Code for America.

### For Non-coders

####I'm not a programmer or I'm not interested in programming. Can I still get involved?

Yes! As long as you are willing to collaborate and engage there are numerous ways in which to be involved. As you can tell from our name, coding is a big part of what we do. But helping solve challenges in the community takes more than software expertise. Our brigade volunteers also have backgrounds in marketing, design, sales, facilitation, nonprofits, project management, and more. Additional perspectives and experiences are always valued and welcome, so come on down!

#### Where do we keep project docs, and how do we collaborate?
#### How do I dive into the code?



####I'm a beginner programmer. Can I still get involved?

Yes! Many of our members have been beginning programmers who have found the environment helpful to improve their abilities while providing something of value.



####What languages / frameworks do you typically use?

We don't use one particular language or framework all of the time. What we use depends on the nature of the project and the groups that we serve.

[THIS ISN'T STRICTLY TRUE.] Our tech leads use clojure, react.js, and Rails. See github page.
Even if that isn't what you work in, contributing is still possible.
