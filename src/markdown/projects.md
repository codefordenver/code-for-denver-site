# Projects
Code for Denver partnered with organizations on these projects last year:
- [Colorado Anti Violence Program](http://coavp.org/)
Responsive tool that streamlines internal reporting and external intake forms.

- [Rocky Mountain MicroFinance Institute](http://www.rmmfi.org/)
Internal workflow for volunteer relationship management.

- [Fresh Food Connect](http://www.freshfoodconnect.org/#/)
Transactional web pages for connecting urban gardeners, delivery agents (cyclists), and organization for re-distribution of food.

- [Rocky Mountain Farmers Union](https://feed.rmfu.org)
An interactive series of web pages, mobile ready/responsive that featured communication through a “flow” of information most important to members.

- [City of Denver Energy Efficiency](?)
A map of Energy Star rated buildings in Denver.

>"Working with Code for Denver was amazing. Witnessing the way that they engage the community in participation and commitment was so inspiring, and the work they did in understanding our organization, and the lengths that their volunteers went to in order to research our unique needs was unprecedented.  The processes that they used not only delivered a useful and customized end product for the company, they informed and influenced the ways that we will strive to work with our own teams and members in the future.
