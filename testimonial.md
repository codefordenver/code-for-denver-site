>Working with Code for Denver was amazing.  Witnessing the way that they engage the community in participation and commitment was so inspiring, and the work they did in understanding our organization, and the lengths that their volunteers went to in order to research our unique needs was unprecedented.  The processes that they used not only delivered a useful and customized end product for the company, they informed and influenced the ways that we will strive to work with our own teams and members in the future.
Thank you sincerely to Code for Denver for all of your efforts, and I wish you all much future success!
